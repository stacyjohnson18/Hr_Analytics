# HR Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview

This **HR Analytics Dashboard** provides a comprehensive view of key HR metrics, helping HR professionals and decision-makers make informed, data-driven decisions. The dashboard visualizes employee demographics, attrition rates, performance metrics, and workforce diversity, using interactive filters and dynamic visualizations created in Power BI.

## Features
- **Employee Demographics**: Visualizes data by department, age, gender, and location for a quick overview of workforce diversity.
- **Attrition Analysis**: Identifies trends in employee turnover and provides insight into potential causes.
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays employee performance ratings and KPIs to help assess overall employee effectiveness.
- **Workforce Diversity**: Analyzes gender ratio, age group distribution, and diversity across departments.
- **Interactive Filters**: Allows users to filter data by different categories such as department, job role, region, and time period for deeper analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: Primary tool for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Microsoft Excel / SQL / CSV**: Data source(s) used for importing data into Power BI.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used for custom calculations and measures within Power BI.

## Data Source
The data used in this project includes:
- **Employee Demographics Data**: Contains information such as name, age, gender, department, location, etc.
- **Attrition Data**: Historical data of employees who have left the organization, including exit dates and reasons.
- **Performance Data**: Employee performance ratings and key metrics to assess effectiveness.
- **Diversity Data**: Workforce diversity metrics such as gender and age distribution.
